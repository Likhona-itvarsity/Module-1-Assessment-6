        <p><b>In general, natural makeup products are cosmetics that contain ingredients from natural sources, like plants or minerals. These ingredients  are also considered nontoxic and less likely to cause health problems. Since many natural makeup brands prioritize nature, they often use eco-friendly packaging as well. Cosmetics are constituted mixtures of chemical compounds. Cosmetics have various purposes. Those designed for personal care and skincare can be used to cleanse or protect the body or skin.Cosmetics designed to enhance one's appearance makeup can be used to conceal blemishes, enhance one's natural features(such as eyebrows, and eyelashes), add color to a person's face, or change the appearance of the face entirely to resemble a different person, creature or object.
